                    <p><b>Progressive Web Apps (PWA)- </b> PWAs are web applications that provide a native app-like experience
                        to users. They are fast, reliable, and responsive and can be accessed from any device. PWAs can
                        be installed on the user's home screen, and they can work offline. They are built using web
                        technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    <p><b>Responsive Design:</b> With more and more people accessing the web on mobile devices, responsive
                        design has become a necessity. Responsive design ensures that your website looks great on any
                        device, regardless of the screen size. It uses CSS media queries to adjust the layout and
                        content of the website based on the user's device.

                    <p><b>Single Page Applications (SPA):</b> SPAs are web applications that load a single HTML page and
                        dynamically update the content as the user interacts with the application. SPAs provide a fast
                        and seamless user experience since the entire page doesn't need to be reloaded every time the
                        user interacts with the application. They are built using frameworks such as React and Angular.

                    <p><b>Motion UI:</b> Motion UI is a trend that adds animation and other dynamic effects to web pages.
                        Animations can make your website more engaging and provide visual cues to the user. Motion UI
                        uses CSS animations and transitions to add movement to web pages.

                    <p><b>WebAssembly:</b> WebAssembly is a low-level bytecode that can be executed in the browser. It allows
                        developers to write high-performance applications in languages such as C++ and Rust and run them
                        in the browser. WebAssembly is ideal for applications that require high performance, such as
                        games and video editing software.
