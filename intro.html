<p><pre>
    <b> Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Shipranshi Keshri and I am a passionate engineering
 student currently pursuing my degree in  Information Technology at National Institute of Technology.
 Ever since I was young, I have been fascinated by how things work and how they can be improved.
 That's why I decided to pursue a career in engineering, where I can use my problem-solving skills to
 make a positive impact on society.
 Throughout my studies, I have gained hands-on experience in various areas of engineering, including
 some of your core areas of study, electrical circuits, programming.
 Apart from my academic pursuits, I enjoy sports, volunteering, reading books. These 
 activities help me to stay well-rounded and provide a break from the technical aspects of
 engineering.
 Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me. I am excited to continue my journey as an
 engineer and make a positive impact on the world. Please feel free to contact me with any questions
 or opportunities..
